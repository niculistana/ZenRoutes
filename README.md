## ZenRoutes
An application that helps you choose places to go based on a city you are looking to go to.

### Running this application
You can use any popular HTTP server out there, as long as the document root points to this directory's `index.html`. Usually, I recommend a server that works out of the box called [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/). You can then run the application locally under http://localhost:8888/.

### Basic features
- Search for places to go to when given a query
- Navigate for places within the vicinity

### Cool features
- Caching previous results, so you don't have to wait in case you need to see resuts from previous queries
- Adding interesting places to a route that you plan to traverse
- Sending these routes via e-mail

### Planned features
- Store relevant route information in a database and redraw when the user needs to revisit or share map via a link
- Draw actual routes to the map
- Add your own route item
- Send routes as a text
- Localization
- Other technical features are logged under: todo.txt
